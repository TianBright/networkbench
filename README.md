If you like to brag about how great you are at multitasking, stop it, because you are only kidding yourself. Changing tasks without rhyme or reason is wasting your productivity, stressing you out, and possibly causing you to make mistakes.

如果你喜欢吹嘘自己多么擅长同时处理多项任务，那还是算了吧，别自欺欺人了。毫无节拍或理由地换任务只会浪费精力、徒增压力，甚至使你犯错。
